                          My name is Andrew Gaugler and I am a senior Digital Culture and Design Major at Coastal carolina University. My interests include movies, TV Show, games, comic, and animation. Many of these interests are directly connected to or overlap with the Digital Culture and Design field which is one of the major reasons why I chose it as my major. Some big insperations for the projects I have created stem from the media I love like my favorite shows or books.</p>

      					<p class="text-white"> My career asperations are to get involved in the film industry because movies and TV have always been a huge inspiration for what I want to do in the future. I plan to start with a job as a production assistant and work my way up. I want to eventually be a part of a creative team for a movie, show, or animation sometime in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="text-white">My aesthetic is primarily focused on creating atmospheric and expressive designs and compositions.        Another big part of my aesthetic relates to hand drawn art or animation as its a medium and style that has appealed to me my whole life. Ive always appreciated the way the medium can show things that are impossible in our reality.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="text-white text-left">
                          The works I’ve decided to include are my photography work as well as my vector poster designs. The photos I have include pictures of my dog and some various landscape/ environment photos. The vector posters depict key moments from throughout one of my favorite series, One Piece.  The photographs I chose depict my aesthetic because they all use heavy contrast and shadows to create atmospheric snapshots of simple moments. The lighting in these photos are also used to try to create these almost surreal exaggerated colors that really appeals to me. The vector designs represent my aesthetic because the subject matter of the posters is from a 2D animated show which is one of my favorite types of media and even further it’s one of my favorite shows of all time. Also, I tried to use colors to create moody and expressive backgrounds that allow the characters to really pop in the center of each photo.</p>
					     <p class="text-white text-left">The influences and inspirations for my photos comes from the types of pages that I follow on things like Instagram and Reddit that post beautiful shots of landscapes from various locations. Influences for the vector posters comes from my favorite scenes and panels from the One Piece show and comic as well as the many movie posters I’ve seen over the years.</p>
					  	<p class="text-white text-left">When designing the portfolio website itself my rationale was to create something that not only represents my ability to create a site but also has elements that show of some of the design principals we learned this semester. I also created a new vector design to act as the banner photo at the top and bottom of the page with both being simplistic vector designs in a monochromatic color scheme. The top design is blue and the bottom one is yellow and I chose those colors because they contrast each other well. Lastly I coded in a gallery/ lightbox for my works allowing you to click on the image to open the gallery then you can scroll through the large gallery and even use a slideshow function to go through the works as well.
